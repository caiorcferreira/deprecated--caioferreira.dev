# Simple Made ~~Daily~~ (or whenever I can)

My personal blog where I share my ideas about simple code and software development.

Built with GatsbyJS (hence React) :heart:
Forked from [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)

## Usage
This repository need Gatsby CLI installed globally to run
```
npm install -g gastby-cli
```
Then, install the dependencies and run the site
```

``` 
The site will be available at http://localhost:8000
